The Campground | Your small campsite sits among the trees of a forest. Dim light filters down through the canopy, but the broad dark leaves above you block your view of the sky. Your campfire has burned down to embers, but the rest of the camp is orderly and well laid out. your white canvas (t)ent sits on one side of the clearing. On the other side a short path leads to a broader track, running (n)orth and (s)outh through the forest | t % Your Tent % n % The North Path % s % The South Overlook
Your Tent | The interior of your tent is cramped but tidy. A narrow bedroll stretches along one edge of the tent, and your few posessions are gathered along the other edge. You can easily duck back (o)ut of the tent | o % The Campground
The North Path | The path runs north perfectly straight, as though it were etched into the earth with a giant architects square. You can catch a glimpse of night sky ahead and flickering lantern light far down the path to the (n)orth. the path also stretches back towards your camp in the (s)outh. | n % The Castle Gate % s % The Campground
The South Overlook | The path bursts from the forest and drops suddenly over a precipice, making long curving switch backs down to a forested valley. An eclipsed sun hangs still in the dark sky; a ring of white fire superimposed against eternal night. Cracks and pools of light also cover the otherwise dark face of the eclipsing moon, pulsing and shifting in an unguessable pattern. The path can be followed back (n)orth into the forest, or (d)own into the valley. | n % The Campground % d % The Woodcutter Village
The Castle Gate | This is the gate of a large stone castle, separated from the path by a broad moat. An eclipsed sun squats above you on the horizon, leaving the castle trapped in perpetual twilight. A drawbridge is currently lowered, allowing travellers to cross over the moat on foot or horseback. Sternfaced guards watch you from between the parapets, but make no motion to halt your progress. You can hear festive music playing through the gate.  the path can be followed back (s)outh, or (n)orth through the gate | s % The North Path % n % The Castle Courtyard
The Castle Courtyard | Just inside the gate of the castle a celebration is taking place in the courtyard. richly appointed castle-dwellers mill and dance about, and a small band of musicians plays a lively jig while motleyed acrobats entertain the crowd. On the (r)ight side of the courtyard, you see a small general store that seems to be open. To the (n)orth, an imposing stone keep rises from the cobbled courtyard like a gargoyle studded mountain. To the (e)ast, a small sally-port lies open, showing a path headed off into the woods. | r % The General Store % n % The Keep % e % The Cross Roads
The General Store | This cozy store is tended by an enormously fat man, and is crammed full of a dizzying array of wares and provisions. You spend a few minutes looking around the shop, then spend a few coins replenishing the supplies in your pack. There is an exit back (o)ut to the courtyard. | o % The Castle Courtyard
The Keep | As you enter the keep you are stuck by the quality of the light. An enormous red tinged and lensed window dominates one wall amplifying and distorting the dim light of the sun into pools of blazing red matched by areas of deep shadow. Red-robed servants are coming and going through the many doors off the main hall, but the Keep has a sacramental atmosphere, and silence is broken only by whispers. Towards the back of the hall you see a stairway leading (u)p, and the door to the courtyard is located behind you to the (s)outh. | u % The Tower % s % The Castle Courtyard
The Tower | Once you reach the top of the grand staircase leading to the top of the keep, you arrive at a scene of grandeur. The King, along with his chief lieutenant, the royal glassmaker, are standing at the edge of a wide balcony, gazing intently into the distance. Stars fleck the far edges of the sky, but are drowned out by the nimbus of the solar halo to the south. Strange patterns of light flicker along the surface of the eclipsing moon, as though vast and fast moving wildfires blazed along its surface, and then went suddenly dark. Masters from the guild of artisians feverishly sketch the flickering glyphs, and the detritus of their craft lays across the floor. Across the room from the balcony, the three princes lounge, accompanied by their various toadies and concubines. No one seems to take much note of your arrival, and you get a chance to look out towards the horizon. In the far distance you can see the edge of the shade, and the white desert beyond it, shimmering in the baking het of the air. Stairs lead back (d)own | d % The Keep
The Cross Roads | After trudging across the twilit countryside for several hours along a narrow track, you come across a little crossroads, marked by a signpost. In the dim light, you can make out an enormous, glossy raven perched atop the signpost, gazing back at you with a self satisfied air. The signpost indicates you can head (n)orth to "Fort Branseph, (s)outh to the Royal Seat, (e)ast to the Plain of Danehwild, or (w)est to a meeting with the western post road | n % Fort Branseph % s % The Castle Courtyard % e % The Plain of Danehwild % w % The Western Post-Road
The Woodcutter Village | At the bottom of the steep-walled valley you come across a small village inhabited by woodcutters. The few residents outdoors stare at you with glinting eyes, but make no comment as you pass. Small fires sputter and pop near many of the village cabins, and the air is succulent with pine-smoke. To the (n)orth a switchbacked path is cut into the valley wall, leading up. To the (s)outh you can see horsetracks leading from the tiny post-station into the forest, and two the (w)est you can see a light glimmaring in the trees.| n % The South Overlook % s % The Southern Post-Road % w % The Wise-Woman's House
Fort Branseph | blah blah (b)lah | b % The Campground
The Plain of Danehwild | The slim but well-maintained gravel path along which you travel winds for a little while through a series of small hills, but then crests over a ridge, revealing a spectacle of carnage. The broad and grassy plain of Danehwild are soaked in blood and strewn with corpses. A battle was fought here not long ago, and the stench of carrion roils in the wind. Scavengers, animal and human pick the bones of the dead for grisly spoils, while a few abandoned wounded let out the occaisonal moan or gurgle. Your stomach turns, and you resolve to move on quickly to the (w)est or the (e)ast. | w % The Cross Roads % e % The Eastern Post-Road
